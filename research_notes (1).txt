# Recommender System Research

There are two main types of AI recommendation systems:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - Recommends items similar to what the user liked based on item features.
   - Example: If you like a crime movie, the system suggests other movies with similar plots or genres.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Recommends items based on what similar users liked, relying on large amounts of user data.

In this project, we use Content-Based Filtering because we have no user ratings and rely solely on movie descriptions.
